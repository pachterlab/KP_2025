## Overview

This study uses spline regression to analyze longitudinal RNA-seq data and demonstrate its advantages in isoform-level differential expression analysis. Original data used for this study was published by [Mias et. al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-80605-6). The repository includes:

- R scripts for spline model fitting & DE analysis
- Python scripts for spline visualization
- PCA visualization from sleuth outputs (Python, R)
- Processed outputs for pathway analysis and gene-level comparison
- Supplementary files for transparency and reproducibility
